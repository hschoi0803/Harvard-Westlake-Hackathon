My brother keptin a frame on the wallpictures of every motorcycle, car, truck:in his rusted out Impala convertiblewearing his cap and gownwavingin his yellow Barracudawith a girl leaning into himwavingon his Honda 350wavingon his Honda 750 with the boysholding a beerwavingin his first rigwearing a baseball hat backwardswavingin his Mercury Montegogetting marriedwavingin his black LTDtrying to sell real estatewavingback to driving trucksa shiny new rigwavingon his Harley Sportsterwith his wife on the backwavinghis son in a car seatwith his own steering wheelmy brother leaning over himin an old Ford pickupand they arewavingholding a wrench a raga hose a shammywaving.My brother helmetlessrides off on his Harleywavingmy brother's feetrarely touch the ground-waving wavingface pressed to the windno camera to save him. Maxine, back from a weekend with her boyfriend,smiles like a big cat and saysthat she's a conjugated verb.She's been doing the direct objectwith a second person pronoun named Phil,and when she walks into the room,everybody turns:some kind of light is coming from her head.Even the geraniums look curious,and the bees, if they were here, would buzzsuspiciously around her hair, lookingfor the door in her corona.We're all attracted to the perfumeof fermenting joy,we've all tried to start a fire,and one day maybe it will blaze up on its own.In the meantime, she is the one today among usmost able to bear the idea of her own beauty,and when we see it, what we do is natural:we take our burned handsout of our pockets,and clap.
